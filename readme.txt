HedmanSoft Milestones allows you to set several milestones in advance and the milestone widget will display the current upcoming event.

== Description ==
HedmanSoft Milestones allows you to set several milestones in advance and the milestone widget will display the current upcoming event.
This is great for recurring meetings that you want to set up in your widget area and not have to change the date each time the milestone passes.
Possible parameters to add to your short code:
'cutoff-days' => 30  				- How many days in the future do we look for an event to display?
'show-header'=>'TRUE' 				- Do we show the header text for the milestone grouping (set to FALSE if you are using a widget and want to use the widget header)
'events-header' => 'UPCOMING EVENTS'		- Header titlel text
'datetime-format' => 'm/d/Y h:i a'		- Format for date and time.  If you include a time format beginning with 'h' or 'H' then the time will be displayed below the date.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/hs_milestones` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->HedmanSoft Milestones screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plug-in for recurring meetings or events? =
Yes, the main purpose of developing this plugin is to enhance the Milestone widget found in JetPack with one that allows you to enter a series of dates and times such that the milestone will automatically appear on a certain date and then go away once that event is over.

= What if I want to show multiple milestone events at the same time? =
Another important feature of HedmanSoft Milestones is the ability to show as many concurrent milestone notices as you want.
